# Customer Segmentation


            Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies
            can market to each group effectively and appropriately.  In business-to-business marketing, a company might segment 
            customers according to a wide range of factors, including: Industry. There are different type of segmentation.
   
            Geographic Customer Segmentation
            Demographic Customer Segmentation
            Behavioral Customer Segmentation
            Firmographic Customer segmentation
            Psychographic Customer Segmentation
            Smart customer segmentation
    
            In this project, Behavioral customer segmentation is performed using 
    
              1. RFM Analysis
              2. K-means Clustering
              
# 1. Customer Segmentation using  RFM Analysis    


            1. Visualize the R,F,M values to determine the cutoffs
            2. Segment the customers based on the cutoffs
            3. Profile the RFM segments
            4. Visualize the churn rate across the segments
            
            
# 2. Customer Segmentation using K- Means Clustering

            1. Check the skewness of the variables ( Skewed variables give unstable clusters )
            2. Tranform the variables if required
            3. Scale the variables ( Raw variables might have different units )
            4. Try multiple K- values and choose elbow method to choose k
            5. Perform K-means clustering
            6. Check the cluster size
            7. Profile the clusters
            8. Visualize the churn rate across the clusters
